            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p class="lead">Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie was an American computer scientist.He created the C programming
                language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">In 1967, Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center,
                and in 1968, he defended his PhD thesis on "Program Structure and Computational Complexity" at Harvard
                under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Ritchie was best known as the creator of the C programming language, a key developer
                of the Unix operating system, and co-author of the book The C Programming Language, and was the 'R' in
                K&R (a common reference to the book's authors Kernighan and Ritchie). Ritchie worked together with Ken
                Thompson, the scientist credited with writing the original Unix; one of Ritchie's most important
                contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms.[8] They were so influential
                on Research Unix that Doug McIlroy later wrote, "The names of Ritchie and Thompson may safely be assumed
                to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed."</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The C language is widely used today in application, operating system, and embedded
                system development,
                and its influence is seen in most modern programming languages. Unix has also been influential,
                establishing concepts and principles that are now precepts of computing.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify"> Ritchie has described a 1970s collaboration with James Reeds and Robert Morris on a
                ciphertext-only
                attack on the M-209 US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000–2500 letters.[10]
                Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the NSA, the authors decided not to publish it, as they
                were told the principle was applicable to machines then still in use by foreign governments.
